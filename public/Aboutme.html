<p>Hi, I'm Diogenes Guiritan Jr. I'm passionate about staying active and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, with hobbies that include
weight training and running. These activities keep me motivated, disciplined, and focused—traits that I apply to all
areas of my life. <p>
<p>I have a deep interest in technology, science, and human psychology. I'm fascinated by how these fields intersect, and
I'm always eager to learn more about how technology shapes our world and our understanding of the mind.

I’m currently working towards my degree in Information Technology and will be graduating soon. I'm excited about the
opportunities ahead and eager to apply my skills to the tech industry. I look forward to using my knowledge to
contribute to innovative projects that make a real-world impact.
